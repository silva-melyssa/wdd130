    <h2>Melyssa Santos da Silva</h2>
    <p> Hello, I am Melyssa Silva, but everybody usually just calls me "Melyssa" or "Mel," or just "Me." I'm 22 years old, and I'm from São Paulo, in the state of São Paulo, Brazil, where I have lived my whole life with my family. I come from a large family with 7 brothers, and I am the only girl. I have been a member of the church my whole life. In January of this year, I returned from my mission where I served in the Brazil Fortaleza East Mission.</p>
    <p>Before my mission, I was studying Business, but I always had a passion for technology. So, when I returned, I changed my major to Applied Technology, and I am loving my studies. I am currently working at the Brazil MTC, and I love my job. I have a deep love for the gospel of Jesus Christ and enjoy teaching, so it's an amazing experience to work there. I also love sports; during high school, I was part of the handball and futsal teams.</p>
    <p>There is a quote from Elder Richard G. Scott that says: "We become what we want to be by consistently being what we want to become each day." This quote helps me in every area of my life, reminding me that to become the person I want to be, I need to be that person every day.</p>
